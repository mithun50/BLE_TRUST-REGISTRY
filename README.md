## Overview

A research prototype for passive Bluetooth Low Energy anomaly detection. It watches how nearby BLE devices advertise themselves over time, builds a behavioral fingerprint for each one, and flags anything that deviates from what it's learned to expect. Suspicious events get logged to a tamper-evident local ledger and surfaced through a browser dashboard.

Built as an academic project at DBIT Bengaluru to explore whether behavioral analysis of BLE traffic can work as a lightweight, zero-infrastructure anomaly detection layer - no packet decryption, no deep protocol inspection.

---

## The Problem

BLE devices advertise continuously and passively. MAC addresses, signal strength, service UUIDs, timing patterns - all broadcast freely, with no authentication. In any dense space (campus, office, hospital), it's genuinely hard to tell whether a device belongs there or not.

Most BLE security research goes the cryptographic route. This project takes a different angle: instead of looking at *what* a device is saying, it asks *how* it's behaving - and whether that matches what was seen before.

---

## What It Does

- **Two-phase operation** - explicit `baseline` mode to learn normal behavior, then `monitor` mode to catch deviations. Model never trains and tests on the same data in the same run.
- **Behavioral fingerprinting** - per-device features: mean RSSI, advertisement interval (mean + std), packet count, service UUID count
- **Isolation Forest detection** - contamination rate adjusts dynamically based on dataset size to reduce false positives on small scans
- **Three-tier alerts** - LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH based on anomaly score thresholds, logged persistently to CSV
- **Local blockchain ledger** - SHA-256 linked blocks store verified fingerprints; chain integrity is verified on every load
- **Duplicate suppression** - re-adding a device is skipped if its behavior hasn't meaningfully changed (within 10% tolerance)
- **Attack simulator** - injects synthetic anomalous devices (spoofing, flooding, rogue AP, erratic patterns) directly into the dataset so you can test detection without a real attacker
- **Flask dashboard** - live view of devices, alerts, blockchain state, and scan controls in the browser

## Installation

Python 3.9+. Tested on Windows 10/11 (Classic BT scanning uses the Windows PnP API - BLE scanning via bleak is cross-platform but full functionality is Windows-only).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manasvi-0523/BLE_mirror.git
cd BLE_mirror

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

No extra config needed. All tuneable parameters (scan duration, cycle counts, contamination rate, alert thresholds) are in `config.py`.

---

## Usage

### Baseline Mode

Run this first, in an environment where the devices present are ones you trust.

```bash
python main.py --mode baseline
# default: 2 scan cycles x 15 seconds each

python main.py --mode baseline --cycles 3
```

Clears the old dataset, records per-device RSSI/interval/packet/service features across all cycles, trains and saves the Isolation Forest model, and writes verified devices to the blockchain ledger.

### Monitor Mode

Loads the trained model and flags behavioral deviations.

```bash
python main.py --mode monitor
# default: 5 cycles

python main.py --mode monitor --cycles 10
```

Fails clearly if you haven't run baseline first. Prints an alert summary and blockchain integrity check at the end.

### Web Dashboard

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Shows detected devices, alert history, blockchain state, and lets you trigger scans from the browser. Scans launched from the dashboard spawn a separate console - check that window for output.

### Attack Simulator

```bash
python attack_simulator.py
# interactive menu

python attack_simulator.py spoofing 20 10
# inject spoofing attack, 20 packets over 10 seconds
```

Attack types: `spoofing`, `flooding`, `scanner`, `erratic`, `rogue_ap`. Packets are written directly to `dataset/ble_data.csv` - run monitor mode afterward to see if detection picks them up.

### Full Workflow

```
1. python main.py --mode baseline      # learn what's normal
2. # verify: look for "[AI] Model successfully trained & saved"
3. python attack_simulator.py          # optional: inject a test attack
4. python main.py --mode monitor       # detect anomalies
5. cat alerts/alerts.csv               # review what was flagged
```

Re-running `--mode baseline` resets everything. Do that intentionally - it clears the dataset and starts a fresh chain.

## What Not to Commit

These are all covered by `.gitignore` - don't force-add them:

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `dataset/ble_data.csv` | Contains MAC addresses and signal data of real devices in your environment |
| `blockchain/chain.json` | Environment-specific runtime ledger |
| `alerts/alerts.csv` | Alert log - may contain device identifiers |
| `ai_model/isolation_forest.pkl` | Fitted to your devices, not portable |
| `ai_model/scaler.pkl` | Fitted to your environment's data distribution |

---

## Limitations

Worth knowing before you rely on this for anything serious:

- **MAC randomization breaks tracking.** Most modern phones (Android 10+, iOS 14+, Windows 10+) rotate their MAC addresses. This system tracks by MAC, so those devices appear as new on every connection.
- **Small scans are unreliable.** Isolation Forest needs a reasonable sample. Under ~10 devices, results are noisy regardless of settings. The `MIN_DEVICES_FOR_MODEL = 3` guard will warn but still proceed.
- **No real-time scanning.** Detection runs in discrete cycles. A device that appears and disappears within a single 15-second window can be missed entirely.
- **Shallow features.** RSSI, interval, and service count are trivially spoofable by anyone who knows what they're doing. This catches unsophisticated behavioral anomalies, not targeted evasion.
- **Windows-only for full functionality.** Classic BT scanning is silently skipped on Linux/macOS.
- **Dashboard subprocesses.** No real-time log streaming - scan output goes to a separate console window.

This is a research prototype. Academic evaluation and demonstration, yes. Production security tool, no.

## Potential Future Work

- **Persistent trust scores** - replace binary NORMAL/ANOMALY with a 0-100 per-device score that accumulates across sessions and decays for absent devices
- **Proper scanner context manager** - `__enter__`/`__exit__` instead of the current unreliable `__del__` cleanup
- **Full blockchain verification in dashboard** - current `/api/blockchain` route only checks `previous_hash` linkage; should also recompute each block's hash to catch content-level tampering
- **Email/webhook alerts** - opt-in notification on HIGH criticality events, credentials via environment variables
- **Persistent model reuse** - `--retrain` flag instead of retraining from scratch on every baseline run
- **Merkle tree integrity** - stronger structure than a linear SHA-256 chain
- **Cross-platform Classic BT** - replace Windows PnP with a platform-agnostic fallback
